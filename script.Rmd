# Replication Crisis

### Evidence of a problem

- `Reproducibility Project: Psychology` <small>(OSC, 2015)</small>  
  - ~40/100 replicated
- `Social Sciences Replication Project` <small>(Camerer et al., 2018)</small>
  - 13/21 replicated
- `Multiple large-scale Registered Reports`

---

# Replication Crisis

### Addressing the problem

--

- Many potential causes for replication failures
  - False positives
  - Incompetent replicators
  - Unknown moderators (imprecise theory?)
  - Contextual differences
  - Etc.
--

- Solution depends on the cause
--

- What should we expect of replications? What does replication "look like"? (statistically, practically)

---

# Many Labs Projects

Large collaborations of researchers replicating the same findings. Each project examines a different aspect of replication.

--

- 5 "Many Labs" projects completed or in-progress.
--

- I'm presenting Many Labs 2 (December)
--

- Same thing as Many Labs 1 (2014), but much bigger.

# Many Labs 2

- <b>Goal: </b>Replicate studies all around the world, compare variation by context/population.
--

- Replicated 28 studies
--

  - Selected for impact, diversity of content, possibility for variation across sites (more at osf.io/8cd4r/)
--

  - Split across two study "packages" due to length
--

  - Computerized in Qualtrics, random presentation order
--

  - Each reviewed by original authors or other experts (Registered Report)

# Discussion

--
- Low variation across sample/context
  - Despite translation, culture, population differences

--
  - Not reasonable to assume sample moderators; test empirically

--
  - Good news for global collaboration

--
- Furthers understanding of replication
  - Informs power analysis (Kenny & Judd, 2019)

--
- Replication rate aligns with other projects
  - Is this meaningful?

--
- Many studies replicate robustly (and robust replicability is a feasible goal)
  - Failed replications =/= false positive
